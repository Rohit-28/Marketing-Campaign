# Marketing-Campaign-optimisation   :atom_symbol: :signal_strength:
The data science project, analyze the marketing campaign revenue optimization with the help of **Statistical Analysis** and Modeling a framework for the same.Project covers **Descriptive Statistical** analysis of data, **Presciptive analysis** using algorithms like *Simplex Linear Programming* using MS-excel based modeling & algebric modeling, as well as Predictive analysis of revenue optimisation with *Multiple-Linear-Regression* Modeling. One module also includes *Social-Medial-Marketing-Campaign* anaysis based on **Clustering Algorithm**.

#### The test data sets used in the project are as below
* marketing.csv
* marketing-mix.xsls
* social-media-marketing.csv
